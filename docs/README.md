# Generated Documentation From Example Code in Presentations Repository

Each example source file contains

---

Currently [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) is used to extract and generate documentation from the examples code. In the future, additional tools such as [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) may be used. Sphinx provides a modern look and feel and additional capabilities to tie together tutorials and example code. Sphinx uses the [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) markup language.

The generated documentation for the example code is [here](https://connectivecpp.github.io/presentations/).

This README file is also included as the main page of the generated Doxygen HTML.
