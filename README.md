# Presentations and Example Code

This repository contains presentations and example code from members of the Connective C++ organization, primarily about the C++ language, but other topics and languages are covered.

Cliff Green has the following presentations, made for either the [New Mexico C++ Programmers](https://www.meetup.com/new-mexico-cpp-programmers/) Meetup group or the [Albuquerque Google Developers Groups](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-albuquerque/):

- [A Tasty Intro to Generic Programming in C++](./presentations/ATastyIntroToGenericProgrammingInC%2B%2B.pdf)
- [Unit Testing in C++ With the Catch2 Library](https://github.com/connectivecpp/presentations/blob/main/presentations/UnitTestingC%2B%2BWithCatch2.pdf)
- [Create Your Own Open Source Project](https://github.com/connectivecpp/presentations/blob/main/presentations/CreateYourOwnOpenSourceProject.pdf)

Currently (Oct 24, 2023) the example code is not yet uploaded to this repository, but CMake files are being worked on and example code should be uploaded sometime in November, 2023.
