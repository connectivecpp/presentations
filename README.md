### Presentations Repository Generated Documentation From Examples

The generated documentation from the presentations example code is available [here](https://connectivecpp.github.io/presentations/).

Currently Doxygen is the only tool being used to generate documentation. Future revisions may include tools such as Sphinx for a nicer, more modern look and feel as well as better integration between tutorial files.
