# Presentations and Example Code

This repository contains presentations and example code from members of the Connective C++ organization, primarily about the C++ language, but other topics and languages are covered.

Cliff Green has the following presentations, made for either the [New Mexico C++ Programmers](https://www.meetup.com/new-mexico-cpp-programmers/) Meetup group or the [Albuquerque Google Developers Group](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-albuquerque/):

- [A Tasty Intro to Generic Programming in C++](./presentations/ATastyIntroToGenericProgrammingInC%2B%2B.pdf)
- [Unit Testing in C++ With the Catch2 Library](https://github.com/connectivecpp/presentations/blob/main/presentations/UnitTestingC%2B%2BWithCatch2.pdf)
- [Create Your Own Open Source Project](https://github.com/connectivecpp/presentations/blob/main/presentations/CreateYourOwnOpenSourceProject.pdf)
- [std::span in C++](https://github.com/connectivecpp/presentations/blob/main/presentations/StdSpanInC%2B%2B.pdf)

Currently (April 2024) the example code is being updated, including CMake files. All of the example code has unit tests, using the Catch2 testing library. The [README](examples/README.md) file in the `examples` directory has additional information.
