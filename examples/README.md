# Example Code for Presentations

This directory contains example source code from the [presentations](<../presentations>) directory.

Most of the example source code has Catch2 unit test code. The Catch2 unit test presentation (of course) features 
the unit test code. Each directory corresponding to a presentation has a top level CMake file.
